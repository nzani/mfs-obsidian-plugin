# The Map File System: Obsidian Plugin

Welcome to the Map File System: the file system built around maps! This project
was designed to help a DM/GM build out their world, with maps as the central 
framework for linking files, documents, and information. 

The idea is simple: imagine that your top directory has a map associated with
it, the map of your world. You can then populate this world map with pins, which
either represent documents or subdirectories, which contain information about
something within your map at the pins location. With this, a DM/GM can fill out
their world by _location_ and use their maps to do so. 

## Development Setup

To develop, you will need to have [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Node.js]
(https://nodejs.org/en), and [Node Package Manager]

- add directory called `vault` to project
- open this up in obsidian to create the test vault
- add in a `plugins` folder to `.obsidian/`, and add a `mfs-obsidian` directory
    - copy `main.js` and `manifest.json` here when building
